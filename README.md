## What is this?
A movie log/curration with basic reviews and data
Films marked with (NWF) were so bad, I was Not Willing to Finish them.

## The vague/flexible guidelines
1. Occasionally the scores are adjusted based on a comparison with surrounding movies in the ranking chain. When they are viewed side by side, it is much easier to decide which movie was preferred

2. I do not enjoy excessively violent films, or those fixated on the evils of the world as a main theme. Because of that, if I end up watching a movie with that kind of content, it is likely to get a lower score. Also, some films are just rated very lowly because I wouldn't recommend anyone bother wasting their time with them. For many of these, it's not necessarily tied to the movie's production quality or director so much as its content is - to me - not worth putting in your brain.

3. This is an incredibly biased list because it is mine. Anyone expecting to see ratings based on some sort of artistic admiration of the film industry won't find that kind of thing here. I'm responding simply - like a friend telling you what they thought of the movie. In that way, it's a very currated thing. If you don't like the sort of things I like, this project is wholly useless to you.
