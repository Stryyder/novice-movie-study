## What is this?
A movie log/curration - converted to JSON

## Intro
It should be said outright that the types of movies I enjoy are: Inspirational, Based on true stories, Sci-Fi, Action, and Survival. Of course, not all movies fit into these categories - but that broad umbrella of movies is the sort of thing that is likely to be rated higher on the list. 

If you are a fan of the following types of movies, this will not be a useful curration for you: Horror, Overly-Sexual, Excessively Violent, etc. In more broad terms than that, I am interested in movies that display the GOOD mankind is capable of achieving; the amazing, and the truly inspirational (think Schindler's List). While bad was portrayed, it was ultimately GOOD that was portrayed. 

I am not interested in movies that fixate on the BAD of mankind. 

## The vague/flexible guidelines
1. Occasionally the scores are adjusted based on a comparison with surrounding movies in the ranking chain. When they are side by side, it is much easier to decide which movie was preferred

2. I do not enjoy excessively violent films, or those fixated on the evils of the world as a main theme. Because of that, if I end up watching a movie with that kind of content, it is likely to get a lower score. Also, some films are just rated very lowly because I wouldn't recommend anyone bother wasting their time with them. For many of these, it's not necessarily tied to the movie's production quality or director so much as its content is - to me - not worth putting in your brain.

3. This is an incredibly biased list because it is mine. Anyone expecting to see ratings based on some sort of artistic admiration of the film industry won't find that kind of thing here. I'm responding simply - like a friend telling you what they thought of the movie. In that way, it's a very currated thing. If you don't like the sort of things I like, this project might be wholly useless to you.


### Notes
- I've experimented with a sort of grading rubric that would predict how I would enjoy each movie and give me a more "predictable" score. What I've found is that no matter how good the rubric, some movies just hit harder than others. There are too many complex elements to hone in on a rigid, mechanical, unmoving thing like a grading rubric. For that reason, that experiment was a success and I've deleted the rubric.
- As this is not an active priority, I have not yet implemented a way to update this JSON in any sort of automated way. My current setup uses PHP/SQL on an Apache-ish home server which I'm manually exporting to JSON
