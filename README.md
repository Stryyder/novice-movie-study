## What is this?
The movie log for one man containing only the essential data + a gut reaction rating score out of 10. (ranked immediately after watching)

- Occasionally the scores are adjusted based on a comparison with surrounding movies in the ranking chain. When they are side by side, it is much easier to decide which movie was preferred

- I do not enjoy excessively violent films, or those fixated on the evils of the world. Because of that, if I end up watching a movie with that kind of content, it is likely to get a lower score. That said, films with professional grade production quality get an automatic minimum score of 5. That leaves all the B movies as <5 respectively.

- This is an incredibly biased list because it is mine. Anyone expecting to see ratings based on some sort of artistic admiration of the film industry won't find that kind of thing here. I'm responding simply - like a friend telling you what they thought of the movie.


### Notes
- As this is not an active priority, I have not yet implemented a way to update this JSON in any sort of automated way.  My current setup uses PHP/SQL on an Apache-ish home server which I'm manually exporting to JSON
