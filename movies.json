It is professionally crafted as a film, but the characters are as stale as cardboard cutouts. The \"life message\" is lost and confused. The main character is sad, depressed, lonely, and brooding - yet walks past a church without entering. It's a worldly loneliness which stems from not knowing God.","tv":" "},

Thomas Jane does well as a ranger, but bringing this film to London, along with its modern day timeline, makes it far from a western.

Some early film which isn't much of a story, more of a documentary, but still a bit of fun. Some serious audio and other production issues prevent this from being really good.
